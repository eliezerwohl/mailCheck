# mailCheck

Google script which checks my emails for an inbound email from my server.  If it see it, it logs it and puts it in the trash.  Otherwise, it sends me an email to my main acccount something has gone wrong.

It's my way to test if my email server is okay.  

I didn't send the inital email to my main account because it would be annoying to constantly get emails.  This way, I only get an email if something is wrong.
